## cash_register.js

Write the rest of the logic to perform the necessary functions to achieve the goal.  
You may create modules within `cash_register.js` in order to separate concerns.  
For example, the function of updating the `( display )` should be handled in one place, or one module, instead of interweaved throughout the spaghetti.
